# Emotion Space (Per Specification)

## 1. Definition

Emotion space is the productive evaluation of everything real and everything ideal:

$$
\text{Emotional Space} = (\text{Real Things})(\text{Ideal Things})
$$

Emotion space is also the productive evaluation of capability space, motive space, and sensory space:

$$
\text{Emotional Space} = (\text{Capability Space})(\text{Motive Space})(\text{Sensory Space})
$$

The normal filter function of emotional space is attention:

$$
\text{Attention} = (\text{Em})
$$

The normal existence term in emotional space is emotion:

$$
\text{Emotion} = \text{Em}
$$

## 2. Component Spaces

### 2.1 Capability Space

Normal existence term:

$$
\text{Ability} = \text{Ab}
$$

### 2.2 Motive Space

Normal existence term:

$$
\text{Ambition} = \text{Am}
$$

### 2.3 Sensory Space

Normal existence term:

$$
\text{Feelings} = \text{Fe}
$$

## 3. Emotion Equation

Emotion is the productive evaluation of ability, ambition, and feelings:

$$
\text{Em} = \text{Ab} \cdot \text{Am} \cdot \text{Fe}
$$

This is the required composition of emotional space through its three component spaces.

## 4. Logical Motion Framework

Logical motion is represented using change functions (derivatives) and integral functions.

### 4.1 Capability Motion

$$
\text{Development} = \text{Ab}'
$$

$$
\text{Investment} = \text{Ab}''
$$

$$
\text{Luck} = \text{Ab}'''
$$

$$
\text{Potential} = \int \text{Ab}\,dt
$$

Filter function:

$$
\text{Opportunity} = (\text{Ab})
$$

### 4.2 Motive Motion

$$
\text{Motivation} = \text{Am}'
$$

$$
\text{Inspiration} = \text{Am}''
$$

$$
\text{Creativity} = \text{Am}'''
$$

$$
\text{Passion} = \int \text{Am}\,dt
$$

$$
\text{Belief} = \iint \text{Am}\,dt^2
$$

Filter function:

$$
\text{Interest} = (\text{Am})
$$

### 4.3 Sensory Motion

$$
\text{Influence} = \text{Fe}'
$$

$$
\text{Impact} = \text{Fe}''
$$

$$
\text{Shock} = \text{Fe}'''
$$

$$
\text{Mentality} = \int \text{Fe}\,dt
$$

Filter function:

$$
\text{Favorite} = (\text{Fe})
$$

### 4.4 Emotion Motion

First change function of emotion:

$$
\text{Productivity} = \text{Em}'
$$

So motion in emotion space is induced by motion in capability, motive, and sensory spaces through:

$$
\text{Em} = \text{Ab} \cdot \text{Am} \cdot \text{Fe}
$$

## 5. Sentiment in Emotion Space

Difference between a signal point and a reference point in emotional space is sentiment:

$$
\text{Sentiment} = \text{Se}
$$

$$
\text{Se} = [\text{Em}]_{\text{signal}} - [\text{Em}]_{\text{reference}}
$$

Equivalent delta form:

$$
\text{Se} = \Delta \text{Em}
$$
